# go-htmx-tailwind

A web app template built with:
- GO
- HTMX
- TailwindCSS

## Quick Start

Dev mode:
```bash
# Run vite in dev mode (from /frontend).
# Note that this runs `vite build --watch` under the hood.
pnpm dev

# Build and run the app (from /).
go run ./cmd/app
```

## TODO

Currently, the vite manifest is not reloaded during dev mode. This needs to be fixed based on the suggestions here: https://vitejs.dev/guide/backend-integration.html
