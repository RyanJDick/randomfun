5. Segment Anything Dataset
Our dataset, SA-1B, consists of 11M diverse, high-
resolution, licensed, and privacy protecting images and
1.1B high-quality segmentation masks collected with our
data engine. We compare SA-1B with existing datasets
and analyze mask quality and properties. We are releasing
SA-1B to aid future development of foundation models for
computer vision. We note that SA-1B will be released un-
der a favorable license agreement for certain research uses
and with protections for researchers.
Images . We licensed a new set of 11M images from a
provider that works directly with photographers. These im-
ages are high resolution (3300 4950 pixels on average),
and the resulting data size can present accessibility and stor-
age challenges. Therefore, we are releasing downsampled

For single point experiments, 1000 masks per dataset
were selected randomly from the same subsets used for
benchmarking zero-shot interactive segmentation (see §D.1
for details on these subsets). The model input was the cen-
termost point, calculated as the largest value of the distance
transform from the edge of the mask. For instance seg-
mentation experiments, 1000 masks were selected from the
LVIS v1 validation set, and the model input was the LVIS
ground truth box. In all experiments, masks with a size
smaller than 242pixels were excluded from sampling, to
prevent showing raters a mask that was too small to judge
accurately. For both memory and display reasons, large im-
ages were rescaled to have a max side-length of 2000 before
predicting a mask. In all experiments, the same inputs were
fed to each model to produce a predicted mask.
For comparison, the ground truth masks from each
dataset were also submitted for rating. For single-point

Model Overview
Name SAM or Segment Anything Model
Version 1.0
Date 2023
Organization The FAIR team of Meta AI
Mode type Promptable segmentation model
Architecture See §3

Intended Use
Primary intended uses SAM is intended to be used for any prompt-based segmentation task. We explored its use in segmenting objects
from a point (§7.1), edge detection (§7.2), segmenting all objects (§7.3), and segmenting detected objects (§7.4).
We explored how SAM can integrate with other vision models to segment objects from text (§7.5).

this will make our work more equitable for real-world use
cases. We provide model and dataset cards in the appendix.
Experiments (§7). We extensively evaluate SAM. First, us-
ing a diverse new suite of 23 segmentation datasets, we ﬁnd
that SAM produces high-quality masks from a single fore-
ground point, often only slightly below that of the manu-
ally annotated ground truth. Second, we ﬁnd consistently
strong quantitative and qualitative results on a variety of
downstream tasks under a zero-shot transfer protocol using
prompt engineering, including edge detection, object pro-
posal generation, instance segmentation, and a preliminary
exploration of text-to-mask prediction. These results sug-
gest that SAM can be used out-of-the-box with prompt en-
gineering to solve a variety of tasks involving object and
image distributions beyond SAM’s training data. Neverthe-
less, room for improvement remains, as we discuss in §8.
Release. We are releasing the SA-1B dataset for research

Caveats and recommendations SAM has impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of tasks. We note, however, that in the zero-shot
setting there may be multiple valid ground truth masks for a given input. We recommend users take this into
consideration when using SAM for zero-shot segmentation. SAM can miss ﬁne structures and can hallucinate
small disconnected components. See §8 for a discussion of limitations.
Relevant Factors
Groups SAM was designed to segment any object. This includes stuff andthings .
Instrumentation and environment We benchmarked SAM on a diverse set of datasets and found that SAM can handle a variety of visual data including
simulations, paintings, underwater images, microscopy images, driving data, stereo images, ﬁsh-eye images . See
§D.1 and Table 7 for information on the benchmarks used.
Metrics
Model performance measures We evaluated SAM on a variety of metrics based on the downstream task in our experiments.

capabilities come from large-scale supervised training. In
cases where data engines can scale available annotations,
like ours, supervised training provides an effective solution.
Compositionality. Pre-trained models can power new ca-
pabilities even beyond ones imagined at the moment of
training. One prominent example is how CLIP [82] is used
as a component in larger systems, such as DALL E [83].
Our goal is to make this kind of composition straightfor-
ward with SAM. We aim to achieve this by requiring SAM
to predict a valid mask for a wide range of segmentation
prompts. The effect is to create a reliable interface between
SAM and other components. For example, MCC [106] can
easily use SAM to segment an object of interest and achieve
strong generalization to unseen objects for 3D reconstruc-
tion from a single RGB-D image. In another example, SAM
can be prompted with gaze points detected by a wearable

device, enabling new applications. Thanks to SAM’s abil-
ity to generalize to new domains like ego-centric images,
such systems work without need for additional training.Limitations. While SAM performs well in general, it is
not perfect. It can miss ﬁne structures, hallucinates small
disconnected components at times, and does not produce
boundaries as crisply as more computationally intensive
methods that “zoom-in”, e.g. [18]. In general, we expect
dedicated interactive segmentation methods to outperform
SAM when many points are provided, e.g. [67]. Unlike
these methods, SAM is designed for generality and breadth
of use rather than high IoU interactive segmentation. More-
over, SAM can process prompts in real-time, but neverthe-
less SAM’s overall performance is not real-time when using
a heavy image encoder. Our foray into the text-to-mask task
is exploratory and not entirely robust, although we believe
it can be improved with more effort. While SAM can per-

bounding box in MIAP, resulting in 3.9k masks.
Fairness in segmenting clothing. We extend our analysis
from §6 to clothing segmentation. We look at SAM’s per-
formance on clothing relative to the attributes of those wear-
ing the clothes. We use all 6.5k ground truth masks from
Open Images that have a category under the clothing super-
class and reside within a person box from MIAP. In Table 6
we compare performance across perceived gender presenta-
tion and age group. We ﬁnd that SAM is better at segment-
ing clothing on those who present predominantly mascu-
line, with disjoint 95% conﬁdence intervals. The gap closes
when moving from 1 to 3 point evaluation. Differences for
perceived age group are not signiﬁcant. Our results indicate
there is a bias when segmenting clothing across perceived
gender presentation with a one point prompt, and we en-
courage users of SAM to be mindful of this limitation.

AI: To evaluate the fairness of the model, the authors used the More Inclusive Annotations for People (MIAP) dataset to measure the performance discrepancy of SAM between groups based on perceived gender presentation, age group, and skin tone. They also used the Open Images dataset to measure the performance of SAM on clothing relative to the attributes of those wearing the clothes. Additionally, they used a proprietary dataset of 794 ground truth masks to compare the mask quality of SAM to ViTDet.
